//! A thread pool for panicking immediately after any monitored threads
//! panic.
//!
//! The key implementation detail is each thread spawned gets a
//! DeathCertificate which sends a message on Drop. This allows us to
//! join a thread once we know it has completed execution, meaning
//! we don't block joining one thread while another thread has panicked
//! already.
